Since SonixIV (Sonix4) is Out-of-Business, there may be a need for repair of their older Ultrasonic Cleaners pre-2007.

For Troubleshooting purposes, the included schematic details the main problems encountered with SonixIV circuit boards.

SonixIV use a specialy "timed" switching diode (D6) , but an UltraFast Switching Diode should work. You may need to experiment.

If needed, the included replacement circuit board Gerbers should work, though they have not been verified.
